## Evidence & Queries

- **Suspicious emails:** E-002, E-006  
- **Malicious documents:** E-003, E-007  
- **Scheduled task creation:** E-004  
- **C2 connections:** E-005, E-007  
- **File manipulation and renaming:** E-008

**Sample KQL Queries:**
```kql
Email
| where sender == "newspaper_jobs@gmail.com" or sender == "valdorias_best_recruiter@gmail.com"

ProcessEvents
| where process_commandline contains "hacktivist_manifesto.ps1" or "plink.exe"

OutboundNetworkEvents
| where url contains "promotionrecruit.com" or "hirejob.com"
```
## Hypotheses

1. The phishing email to Sonia was part of a generic spam campaign = ‚ùå  
2. The `.docx` file was benign and used only for social engineering = ‚ùå  
3. Attackers maintained access via scheduled tasks = ‚úÖ  
4. Data exfiltration occurred via standard web protocols = ‚úÖ  
5. The attacker reused infrastructure across multiple cases = üîÑ Inconclusive

---

## Analysis

- Email headers failed SPF/DKIM validation, supporting phishing origin  
- Malicious `.docx` files triggered embedded PowerShell scripts (`hacktivist_manifesto.ps1`)  
- Scheduled tasks created silently on both UL0M-MACHINE and A37A-DESKTOP  
- SSH tunneling via `plink.exe` enabled remote access to attacker-controlled infrastructure  
- Attackers downloaded and renamed `fakestory.docx` to impersonate a legitimate OpEd  
- Email sent from Ronnie‚Äôs account to Clark Kent resulted in unauthorized publication  
- `.7z` archive creation and upload to `hirejob.com` confirmed data exfiltration  
- IOC overlap suggests broader campaign reuse, pending cross-case correlation

---

## Conclusion & Action Taken

- Compromised endpoints isolated and reimaged  
- Credentials rotated for affected users; MFA enforced  
- Malicious domains blocked at proxy and DNS  
- Editorial workflow updated to require multi-person approval  
- Legal and PR teams engaged for reputational mitigation  
- Dark web monitoring alert escalated to threat intel team  
- Case closed

## Lessons Learned / Next Steps

- Editorial systems must enforce multi-person approval for sensitive publications  
- Phishing awareness training should include realistic job-themed lures  
- Scheduled task creation should be monitored and alerted in real time  
- SSH tunneling tools like `plink.exe` should be flagged in non-admin environments  
- Develop playbook for editorial compromise scenarios  
- Cross-case IOC enrichment needed to confirm infrastructure reuse  
- Automate detection of `.docx` files spawning PowerShell or network activity
