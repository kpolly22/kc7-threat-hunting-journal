On January 22, 2024, *The Valdorian Times* inadvertently published a defamatory article about a mayoral candidate due to a targeted cyberattack that compromised editorial workflows.

---

## Key Findings

- **Targeted Phishing Campaign**  
  Attackers impersonated a job recruitment service and sent phishing emails to six Valdorian Times staff members, including Sonia Gose and Ronnie McLovin.

- **Malicious Document Delivery**  
  Victims downloaded a file titled `Valdorian Times Editorial Offer Letter.docx`, which deployed a PowerShell script (`hacktivist_manifesto.ps1`) and established persistence via scheduled tasks.

- **Remote Access Established**  
  The script downloaded `plink.exe`, enabling SSH tunneling to attacker-controlled infrastructure (`205.129.146.36`).

- **Editorial Manipulation**  
  Attackers gained hands-on-keyboard access to Ronnie McLovin’s device, downloaded a falsified article (`fakestory.docx`), renamed it to match the expected OpEd draft, and emailed it to the newspaper printer under Ronnie’s identity.

- **Unauthorized Publication**  
  The printer, unaware of the compromise, published the falsified article on election day.

- **Data Exfiltration**  
  Attackers exfiltrated documents, desktop contents, and other files from Ronnie’s machine via a custom portal hosted at `hirerecruit.com`.

## Strategic Implications

- **Reputation Risk**  
  The incident resulted in reputational damage and potential legal exposure due to the publication of false political content.

- **Operational Vulnerabilities**  
  Editorial workflows lacked verification safeguards, allowing a single compromised endpoint to influence public-facing content.

- **Security Gaps**  
  Lack of phishing awareness, endpoint monitoring, and outbound traffic controls enabled the attack to succeed without detection until post-publication.

## Recommended Actions

- Conduct a full forensic review of editorial systems and email infrastructure  
- Implement multi-person approval workflows for sensitive publications  
- Deploy phishing simulation and awareness training for all staff  
- Monitor for outbound connections to recruitment-themed domains  
- Review endpoint logging and scheduled task creation policies
